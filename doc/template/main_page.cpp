/// SPNV is a simple viewer for panorama pictures that were created with Hugin.
/// It uses information from the Hugin project files to properly display the
/// panorama scenes on screen and to identify and optionally center the scenes'
/// horizon lines. Pictures of two different panorama projection types, either
/// the central cylindrical or the equirectangular projection, can be displayed.
